# Create a function that takes three parameters where:
#  x is the start of the range (inclusive).
#  y is the end of the range (inclusive).
#  n is the divisor to be checked against.
# Return an ordered list with numbers in the range that are divisible by the third parameter n.
# Return an empty list if there are no numbers that are divisible by n.
